UgxbQDyrnR3_3h1N1H94AaABAg,-kX2b6TF_9k,26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.,2021-05-01,1,0,false

UgwhUlWegdQI0sHBZBd4AaABAg,Q9FjwzKFPuM,Thank you so much for putting this content out.  It's an invaluable resource for someone like myself who is in the process of applying to grad school.  I was wondering if you think the pros and cons of a masters degree outlined in the video would apply to a masters in statistics as well?  I'm currently working in a completely unrelated field and I'm applying to mostly stats programs but a few data science as well.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.,2020-01-29,3,0,false

We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it.

UgwndhGtJR_kneS4Ep54AaABAg,SLC5sPZSLY4,You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats. Lol.,2020-10-08,1,1,false

And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science. Thank you :),2020-09-14,2,1,false

Ugxrup3_8rICjHToWjF4AaABAg,Q9FjwzKFPuM,In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!),2020-12-06,1,3,false

And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias.

UgzTGs6IYTBykFdSzxZ4AaABAg,3BEtGaz70rQ,Love this video and this kind of content.  I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect.  Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out.  Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further.  I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this.  I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt.,2019-09-23,1,1,false
